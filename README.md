ShoptheBlock is an full-stack e-commerce application built to fulfill Nashville Software School's Full-stack Software Development program requirements. This application was my opportunity to utilize both my front and back-end skillset.

_______________________________________________________________________________

This project ran the gamut of challenging development from concept to MVP- from structuring data entity relationships to hours spent dropping breakpoints front and back to solve broken API calls, only to find an extra comma in the SQL query. 
C# Web API, Redux, JWT tokens, and HTTP methods and API development in general. Having completed the front-end half of the course which included a client capstone that utlized JSON RESTful API services with React.JS, I was confident in my abilities to build the UI, but I was quickly humbled by the months spent focusing my energy on learning C#, SQL methods, and learning other back-end technologies.  Although I would have loved to implement a few additional features such as an admin view with varied account priveleges including a product form and seller dashboard, as well as additional sort/filtering on the default user view, I met my minimum viable product by demo day and was proud to graduate from the program.
